# Computational Intelligence

Exercises and assignments made during a Computational Intelligence class at Federal University Of Ceará.

## [Lógica Fuzzy](./assignments/FuzzyLogic/)

Implementation of Fuzzy Logic with Mamdani Inference System. Handfull of class implementation to represent all Mamdani fuzzyfication and defuzzyfication processes.

## [Regression](./assignments/Regression/)

### [Multiple Regression](./assignments/Regression/MultipleRegression.m)

Class implementation of Multiple Regression. Below we have a plan of regression, made in the code that has the [multiple regression instance](./assignments/Regression/questao03.m).

### [Polynomial Regression](./assignments/Regression/PolynomialRegression.m)

Uses the Multiple Regression Implementation as a parent class to easily do a polynomial regression. Below we have the result of the [polynomial regression instance](./assignments/Regression/questao02.m).
